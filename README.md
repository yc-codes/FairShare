Fair Share - A platform where you can share videos very securely and privately. 

The Fair Share is an application developed for preventing hacking of videos being shared via users. The source video is uploaded by the user itself which undergoes through various processes. 

First, we take the video and divide it into 2 parts; each part undergoes different encryption process separately. We use AES and Blowfish algorithm for encryption techniques. 

In this app, video will be saved in encrypted format and saved on the server directly.

After video is successfully uploaded, User can then share the video by selecting the users he wants to share with. User will get list of videos uploaded by him and videos shared with him. Â He can just select the video and download it.

For downloading, different encrypted parts of video is decrypted with their respective algorithm and merged together, And Original video is retrieved.
